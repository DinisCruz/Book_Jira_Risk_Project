Do you think I am wrong? Fine prove me wrong, where is the evidence? Where is the Cyber/App Security market in Portugal which I believe is very, very small.

How many threat models are created per week? How many secure lines of code are? Basically I like to use this phrase a lot, the current security model is based on 'magic fairy' 'hey it is cool, it is like quality' somehow automatically becomes secure that isn't reality.

The good news is we have a lot of talent which I want to get into. 

Don't Worry, You're Safe

So again you are safe and at the moment although we are insecure we are quite safe which is good but it also means we have to beat the time to deal with this stuff.
