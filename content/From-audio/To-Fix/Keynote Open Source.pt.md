Now here comes the most interesting, more radical ideas, every code that is written and paid for government agencies should be released under Open Source License. 

There is no reason why something that we pay as taxpayers, actually be released under propitiatory stuff. It should all be Open Source all documents created under those should be creative commons, Portuguese companies should actually publish their code and license and actually should pay for open source which actually takes a financial model to understand that.

That will create a massive difference, that will create hundreds of tones of companies just supporting open source in Portugal.
