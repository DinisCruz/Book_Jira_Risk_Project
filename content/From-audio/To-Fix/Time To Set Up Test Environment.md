A key element of the test and development and security work flow is how fast can one be in a situation where you can write and execute a test.

So, it is critical that very important attention is placed into the amount of work required to go from a clean laptop, a clean environment all the way to actually being able to write something that runs in real time, as quick as possible you could see the code coverage in real time that you can push to a git repository that will be captured by a continuous integration tool which will then run the same tests in multiple environments and then trigger, let the pipeline continue somewhere else.

So that ability is actually something you can measure and it is something that is actually quite important for making the work flow very smooth.

And this is something like say that you report something on a website or you want to find issue, or you are running a test or you are doing a demo, you find something you shouldn't have at that moment in time to load up the whole project, make this very heavy, very expensive development operations. 

There should be a whole suite of APIs, a whole suite of CLIs [Command Line Interfaces] that allow these things to occur very smoothly and then allows the time to be spent on writing the test or explaining the test. Because as I mentioned in other places in the book, you should communicate with tests, you should be forced by your brain to actually write tests to explain something because that is the most efficient way to actually perform the explanation of the issue at hand.
