So, Crypto again is essential for this because privacy is essential for human dignity and in a way Cryptography is a public service and is critical to protect user data we really need to embrace it and much better do it.

So great Crypto should be seen as a good thing, shouldn't be sued by some entity who says, "Oh please don't make this device it is so secure that I cannot break them" which again is wrong.
