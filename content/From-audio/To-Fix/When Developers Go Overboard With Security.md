An interesting thing that happens when you really get a good grove with developers and they really start to think about application security and they really start to embrace it and doing the threat models and all that jazz is that they can actually sometimes go a bit over the top. They can start to exaggerate and start to see all sorts of threats and all sorts of problems that actually although they exist they aren't really that important or they don't make the application that much dangerous.

So it is an interesting paradigm where you actually find yourself and the security team saying actually that is no problem or that isn't a real risk or okay you can accept that risk because it is no big deal.

And it is understandable because in a way they are now thinking about it and they sometimes don't have as much understanding of the exploit ability of the side effects or even the business impact of a particular issues.

So you have these cases where the application security has to be the voice of reasoning. And that is actually very important that you have credibility so you can't just make everything a massive ticket item because ultimately you need to have a buffer, you need to have a space where if something is really important, if something is relevant actually appears then there is space and time for that to actually be fixed.

And if you abuse that power, either forcing issues from security team or accepting the developers to raise issues that are really not that problematic, eventually it backfires. In a way it is like karma points, you can abuse it but eventually you are going to be caught out and you are going to basically lose a lot of credibility which is actually one of the most important assets that the application security team needs to have.
