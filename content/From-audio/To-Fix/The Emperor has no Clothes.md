So, the Emperor has no new clothes, so Portuguese government and agencies aren't secure, and what we need to accept as a fact for what is coming next to look like radical.

And also very important, there isn't silver bullets or easy solutions, there are a lot of people who want to sell big lovely buttons and big stuff that doesn't exist.

What we have is all this evolution, is about we need to figure out all these paths to go through.

So the logic of this presentation is to make Portugal a player versus being played. We want to be a senior player on the table, we want to control the game, we need to define new rules of the game versus just being a pawn into whatever the game is being played. And we need to prepare for what is coming next especially in terms of AppSec.

And our response to terrorists shows how bad this can do if when the problems occur you aren't ready, you don't have a plan, you don't have a tone to reality and society isn't strong.

Not being funny but the reaction to Sweden, to the terrorist attack that happened there versus the reaction to some other countries it is a massive difference.

So, you could see the value of having a very strong society that has thought about these things.
