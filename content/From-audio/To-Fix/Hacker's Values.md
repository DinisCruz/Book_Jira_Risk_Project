The other thing that is great about hackers is they have great values. You have a very strong ethical foundation based on sharing, respect, friendship, trust, non-discrimination, humanity and companionship.

These aren't fluffy things, this isn't 'oh it is nice to live in this world'. When you are in the hacking community, when you are in that community of sharing information this is what you do. 

I don't care what color of skin you have, I don't care who you are, where you are, where you come from, your history, it doesn't matter. What matters is that we share the same passion for the same problem.

When we had the summit here in Portugal you had people from competing companies all working together to solve a common problem. That is what you want, and that is what the hacking in a way brings in, and I think we need to bring that community to our country.
