So we have some big questions; changes on privacy, liberty, humanity, freedom, work, which are all centered on technology (and secure code) and these questions need to be discussed, understood and addressed.

There are no perfect solutions, we need to achieve a workable compromise and make sure we take the best course of action. 

I don't claim that all my ideas are good, that they will work or are even realistic, especially in the current political and economic system.

But I know that big changes occur when we head in the right direction and can experiment, adapt, re-factor and improve.
