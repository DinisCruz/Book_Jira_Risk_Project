So, we need to create our future, and you have to remember that the hackers that grow up creating distributed systems to attack the network and as part of the example the PT Hacking Service which I will get in for a second, are the same ones that will find really powerful solutions for Portugal.

For example, why don't we have a distributed peer-to-peer drone network to combat fires in Portugal? This is a great use of technology, we can create crypted currencies, we can create all sorts of stuff but it is that generation that would do it.

The same generation that was hacking Linux boxes while we were in university campus is the same generation that is today solving fundamental problems. 

So, we need to make sure that this new generation knows what a raspberry pie is, knows what is inside, knows how to build one. There is a factory in Portugal, you can build that stuff.
