Also another thing is we should export engineers, we should be creating this whole generation of professionals and then send them to the world because they bring Portugal with them in their hearts. 

You can't experience how amazing it was to be in England to see Portuguese win the World Cup, the European Cup it is amazing you know the parties that were there, they were fantastic, it is really nice, nobody really leaves Portugal.

They are ambassadors, they are clients, they connect to Portugal and they are an asset to us, and they will come back one day and share what they have learned. They bring ideas, they bring stuff.

So again this is very key.
