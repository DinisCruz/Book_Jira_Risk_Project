We need disclosure to talk about this stuff, the market at the moment doesn't really work so whistle blowers are actually very important through this kind of stuff.

And again if EU doesn't like it, we should sue the EU, it is time for us to actually push some stuff.

And all this comes down to the way of sovereignty, we need to control the stuff that happens in our country, for example we should have very, very powerful whistle blower laws that allows people to disclose what is going on in the software that happens in here.
