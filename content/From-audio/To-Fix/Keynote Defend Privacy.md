Privacy is very important, is actually human right you ought to be innocent until you are proven guilty. The US and the NSA redefined the notion of privacy which was really bad they went from this idea that when you look at something you are invading somebody's privacy to just when you capture information to when you look at it.

So what happens is the reasoning is I can capture everything about any of us but it is only when they look at the data, when they do a search or something that it actually becomes a potential invasion of privacy which of course is totally crazy, it just justifies that stuff, so we need to change that.

And there is a huge amount of companies that their entire business model depends on us not having privacy which is a problem because it influences a lot of decisions, etc.

And governments are now actually actively making the internet less secure because they want to continue to access that stuff. Which is now a big problem, it used to be they have to defend against criminals, now you have to defend against even governments and other things that actually don't want you to fix problems.
