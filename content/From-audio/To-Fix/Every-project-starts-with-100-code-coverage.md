### Every project starts with 100% code coverage

Every app starts with 100% code coverage because by definition, when you start coding, you cover all the code.  In fact, you probably had infinite code coverage at the moment you started a project.

You must ensure that you have a very high degree of code coverage right from the beginning. Because if you don't, when you add the code coverage later, it is easier to let code slip, and then you realize that large chunks of your code base are not tested.

You need to get back to that 100% every day. If there is a slip batch, or if you find that you added code that wasn't fully tested, you must reverse the coverage back to 100%, or as high as it can be, for the project you're working on. 

Projects of untamed languages have difficulties reaching certain exceptions. But even then, I always find that every factory can handle those situations.

It is very important that you learn the discipline and the habit of always keeping the app. This is where it all makes a big difference, and things like Wallaby and crunch and some other digitizations are very powerful.

In fact, I saw a team using Kibana to track the code coverage which is an interesting metric.
