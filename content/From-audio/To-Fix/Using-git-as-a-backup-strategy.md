### Using Git as a Backup Strategy

When you code, you inevitably go on many different tangents. Git allows you to keep track of those tangents, and record and save your progress.

In the past, we used to code for long periods of time and we committed everything in the end. The problem with this approach was that it was difficult to revisit paths we had visited earlier, or to retrace our steps from a path that turned out to be inefficient.   If you commit early and often, however, you can keep track of all your changes, which is a more efficient way of programming.

Of course, before you make the final commit, and before you send the push to the main repository, you should clean up and make sure the code has a certain degree of quality and testing.

I find that every time I code, even for a short while, my instinct is to write a commit. I keep track of my work in this way, and even if I just add some of the code, or use the staging capabilities to do some selective commits, I find that Git gives me a much cleaner workflow. With Git, I have confidence in my changes along the way and I very rarely lose any code or any snippet I was happy with.
