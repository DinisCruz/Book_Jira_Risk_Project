One of the interesting properties of application security is that it is one of the few entities on the business and development environment that actually asks how things work, how really things work, how data flows, what attack surface exists, what are the schemes, what is the black magic that happens and the application that allows certain things to occur.

So this is why the application security team can play a very powerful game, the InfoSec team also of knowing what exists, knowing how things work. So you could play a great visibility game where you add a lot of value to the business where you actually can be a great help in understanding reality.

What is interesting is that there is a time when developers also have the same question which is the moment that they join the team. The moment that they join the team there is that small period of time, day or week, something or two weeks, it could even be a month it depends on the size of complex of the team and documentation, where the developer also needs to know how things work because it is learning.

The problem is if when the developer learns, if he isn't capturing that information, if he isn't documenting it, if he is not learning from something that already exists from tests, from real time graphs, from real time visualization of what is going on, then what happens is that that information is now uploaded in a way to the developer's brain but it is not going to go anywhere else.

So there is that sweet spot that interesting place where the new developer joins the team at that moment in time he actually is in that also soft place which how does this thing actually work, even like a web page, I have seen developers who spend hours or even days trying to hunt how to get to a specific place of the application.

And basically it is key to realign those efforts, so it is key that every time that happens you capture so you become a bit better. And again you don't have to map everything but it is like the boys' scout rule, 'when you leave, leave it better than it was when you arrived'. 

So, it is quite key that we align those two places of when the Devs also asks the question, "how does it work?". And there is a real business requirement for that, there is a real business case because as people move around teams which is very common, and as new developers join teams there is always somebody who needs to learn how a certain application works.

So if you can make that process smoother and maintainable and scale-able, you have a much better on boarding to actually meet those situations where developers are actually being productive much sooner than what happens at the moment.
