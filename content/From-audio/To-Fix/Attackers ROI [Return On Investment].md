So we have to remember that it doesn't take a lot of money to compromise a country or a company. This is the cost of the zero day, this is the worst case scenario to take to compromise a particular company.

So basically with this, if I had $100,000 to invest, what would I do? I would buy a bunch of zero-days, I would buy compromised machines inside the Portuguese networks, I would buy botnets to attack Portuguese companies.

And basically, how much money can I make out of it? If I can make a million pounds out of it, it makes business sense because it is all about the money.

That is what you need to think about, if there is a million dollars to be made in a particular company, somebody will be able to put a hundred grand into it to invest.

The good news for us is that the attackers are making far much more money doing other stuff but they are growing, but we will get there.

And again, what is the return on investment, and who actually can survive this stuff? And my view is very little companies, especially in Portugal who will be able to survive this kind of stuff.
