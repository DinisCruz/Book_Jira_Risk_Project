We want to inspire the next generation with these values, and it is important to have frames of reference. The thing that I find sometimes you don't have sometimes in Portugal, and even companies not just Portugal is sometimes you have professionals that don't have frames of reference, they have not seen it working.

So, it is very hard to visualize how you can do something when you have never experienced those things. You have that with Dev Ops, you have now with deployment, with coding, you have management guys who never experienced a really powerful software development environment, or really powerful secure environment that creates even faster code and even better code.If you don't experience that you really cannot ask for it.

So, we need to provide these alternative narratives to the current mainstream of lies, non-experts welcome [which is something that happened in UK lately] and infotaiment [which is what you saw this week with the kind of global elections] this is the new reality that we have.
