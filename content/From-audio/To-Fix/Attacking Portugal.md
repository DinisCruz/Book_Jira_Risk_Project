I actually don't want to spend a lot of time on this because I don't want to spend time on the problem. If you don't believe this is a problem then it is a different discussion.

Just pasted some interesting numbers that I managed to get from you guys that is 1.5 Million records on databases the companies leaked etc. 

This is quite interesting, these guys [this is actually awesome, this is actually brilliant] it would be nice to even go another level, and by the way you guys should have crazy funds from the Portuguese government to do this. 

It is one of those cases you probably are a company this big and you should be that big. Because this stuff is absolutely critical for what is coming next. 

So they found these attack vectors. So this is how you can blow up a country, the idea that a country is safe is totally crazy when you have stuff like this.

The amount of damage you can do in a country if you decide to be malicious, I can ask you guys, if you guys were really pissed off at Portugal, how much damage could you do?

There you go, and it is crazy, this used to be funny five years ago it isn't funny anymore. Especially when government agents and criminals are really stepping up. 

And again you if look at the geopolitical move of the world, I think it is time for us to control our technology.

VNC [Remote Desktop Control]

So there you go, this is like basic stuff, this is like hacking like it is 2000.

And remote control system, SCADA stuff, things with clear text protocols, and of course the web apps are even worse. 

But I have covered that, you should really be covering the applications, you should have a mandate to hack everything that moves which I am sure you don't, and I am sure that anybody threatens to law suit you, you guys are screwed because you aren't that big.

But if you are there and you say, "Can you sue Portugal because they gave me the mandate?" that is a different mandate.

What about Web Applications and DDoS

And again the latest DDoS are very interesting because you have to remember that this Denial of Service are done against the biggest companies in the planet and they are not surviving.

I am involved in a company that we got hit by the crossfire, we weren't even the target but we just got hit just because we were sharing some of the networks and sharing e AMA and sharing with some of those guys. We lost money because of these things.

And we weren't even targeted, and if these guys point that to us, we had no chance to deal with this kind of stuff.
