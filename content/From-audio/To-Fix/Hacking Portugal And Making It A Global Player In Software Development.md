The key here is that I think we want to make Portugal a global player in software development.

We want a situation where as technology becomes more important to our society, we really want to make sure that we take it seriously and that Portugal becomes a big player in that world.

And, I view application security as a very powerful enabler of that situation. And application security sits in a very, very interesting way because application security tends to be sometimes the only one that really ask how things work, what happens, what is the attack surface, what really is going on in the applications, and everything is related.

So, when you start with the application, you go all the way to the micro chip because everything is related to what is going on, on that particular website.

And these days, everything is connected to the internet. So, in a way everything is connected to application security and code.

So,I am going to provide a lot of paths, a lot of ideas, a lot of stuff to actually make this first class citizen.
