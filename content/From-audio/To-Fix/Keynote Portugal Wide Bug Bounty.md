So, we need a Portugal wide bug bounty where everything is hackable and you get paid for it. And there is bug bounties everywhere the Pentagon has a bug bounty, where is it? I was trying to find a bug bounty for a Portuguese company I couldn't find one. Probably there is one but they aren't really that well known that just shows you.

And again you crowd source solutions and lead like that.
