So the first and this is probably the key core idea is that I try to come up with all sorts of ways to represent a good path.

And I found this one because I think it fits all the political, government, companies, educational things together. I think we need to make the Portuguese network hostile to insecure code.

We want a situation where we are allergic to basically the situation where somebody can just publish and put insecure code into our network and by the network I mean Portugal.

And we can actually do the same thing for companies, so a company can decide to do the same thing, this presentation is focused on the country, but Microsoft could decide to do the same thing, a lot of companies do a bit of this, but it is nice when it is a global agenda.

Also because Portugal has sovereignty over her network. Although we are part of European Union, there are lines, there are borders that we can actually control, and it is time to bring the digital world into that.

So, my view is that everything I am saying here is fair game in Portugal. Others may not like it, fine, but we can define our own rules.

And this needs to be supported by collaborative commons and if you don't know that term it is a really great concept, I will explain a little bit but it is a very interesting way of working together in a kind of way that makes a lot of sense.

So, you need strong enforcement, you need regulation and you need market pressure to make this work.

The way you want to do this is you want to attack vulnerable code, so I want this situation where vulnerable apps and appliances as soon as they are plugged to a network, they should be hacked within minutes.

Some of the best security teams in the planet, they hack internally. You develop an application in a company and if your app isn't to a certain level of security, certain level of resilience, you will be attacked not by the attackers but by your own teams, and that is what you want.

You want a situation where basically it is hacked by the good guys which are basically trying to help it to fix it or by disabling it.

And this is something that when I presented at the OS Conference here I said let's hack Portugal, everybody was shocked, now five years later with the ideas of the bug bounty and all that stuff this starts to be commonsense.

So we need a mandate from the government and this has to be important because you have to have some kind of mandate for this kind of stuff. You also need to have a situation where in some way the manufacturers gives us this mandate because they publish insecure stuff. 

The way I look at it, if you are a manufacturer, you publish insecure code so you are already giving us permission to compromise it and to fix and to attack it.

And you kind of need some insurance on this because we will brick some devices, so you kind of need to support this a little bit by some insurance in that coverage.
