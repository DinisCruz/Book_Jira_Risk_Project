One of the funniest stories I have heard from this friend who set up a security team is that they knew they had done something right when their is queue of developers and business owners lining up their door to actually ask security questions and to work with them to the point where they said, "hey I am going to actually need a ticketing system like take a little ticket to manage those to actually answer them" that is a very positive sign.

On the other hand, I would say that every time you provide an answer,  every time you deal with somebody you have to hyper-link it so that you scale. So what you don't want is to keep answering the same question over and over again or the same variation of questions.

So, it is very key that you actually capture those, and you actually are able to create resources that are easy to consume, are easy to be updated and in a way are relevant to specific users.

This is actually something that I wondered when I was working under team mentor product that was actually the concept, you basically create a crazy knowledge base and you answer with a link and the link is customized to the application and then it becomes this positive model of actually using it as a living document of security guidance.

So, when you get a question you actually answer with that link which if you show the developer how you got to that link is actually great way to educate that person for the next question that they have, say, "hey go and look here". 

So which basically means that they should be looking on internal resources versus looking at Google stack overflow which might not be the best resources to read the security knowledge and in most cases they aren't going to be customized or very relevant to the actual APIs and programming patterns that are currently in use.
