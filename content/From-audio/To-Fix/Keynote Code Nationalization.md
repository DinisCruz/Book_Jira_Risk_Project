Now the nuclear option here we can also nationalize code. And basically companies critical for Portugal and they don't want to disclose the code guess what if they want to operate in Portugal we can nationalize it.

Yes, it is the nuclear option but it should be on the table. We shouldn't have black magic running in our stuff.

The way I look at it everything that touches Portuguese data and Portuguese networks and Portuguese lives has to be public, peer-review-able,  compile able by independent sources, and signed.

This isn't just websites but IOT devices, network devices, microchips etc. this is what we want to do.

And it is important to understand that that is a red line that is sometimes we cross for certain companies because the stakes of the game are  that high.
