So you might think why Portugal, why do these things in Portugal? Because ironically it is easier here.

Like the drug stuff it is easier to do this in smaller country because there is less agendas, there is big lobbies, you will be known for a while which is great because it can actually make you work, generate momentum.

We have the power, it is already on our hands so this isn't...you don't have to ask for permission, you guys already know people that can make this happen. 

And by the way this is where I can say look I would love to live in Portugal, I would love to come out to Portugal, unfortunately I don't but this is a world I want to live in.

But actually you also need to fight for these things.
