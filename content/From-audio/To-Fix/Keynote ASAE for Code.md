Maybe we should have ASAE for code and I know ASAE has a really, really bad reputation in Portugal but it is also a warning sign because when regulation loses the plot which is what we had in Portugal, we need to learn it.

ASAE had a massive loss of common sense yes they are secure and they are things we have been doing for tradition generations that maybe it is okay to keep doing it like that.

But that is what happens when you get too much regulation which is to understand on the bottom line which is to make you empowerment, good behavior, common sense that is what we want.
