Again European Union is great, I am a strong believer in Europe, I love Europe but Europe needs to reset at the moment I think again Portugal has a good experience of that.

And we shouldn't have to beg to Europe to fund this stuff, I want Europe to sponsor this, to be involved because they want to because Portugal is the best place in the world to do this kind of stuff. We want to be positive not like 'oh just throw me some bones here' because that doesn't scale and you aren't in the power position to negotiate which is what you really want.

So that is what European Union should be about collaborative commons, global village this is the kind of stuff that we really want to see.
