So, open source is actually the key for all this. And I am a very firm believer of open source but not as open source software is great but the model, the values, the work flow that you get with open source.

So, the way I look at it is that most of the ideas here if you don't do this in a very strong open source and creative command's way, it will not work, it actually backfires, you actually will create a commanding control system which is kind of where we are going now anyway.

So, OWASP is a good example of an organization that has a very strong open model from what is created to its governance and fiscal transparency.

And also Git is a great part of this because it gives you some work flows.

FOSS Values

FOSS [Free and Open Source] Open source values again we talked about this, they empower the staff, this is all the stuff you do with open source [access to code, no lock in, no discrimination, liquid collaboration], and it is all positive.

It is all great stuff, it doesn't mean the code is perfect but it is a great model

Open Source is Expensive

Open Source is expensive again you have to realize that we need companies that sell Open Source Code, what we don't want is a lock in.

And of course Open Source Code isn't free, there is a cost, the difference is you pay a bit differently, and you need to pay for it because it is a much better model

Market of Lemons

We have a 'market of lemons' if you guys know the analogy from the cars in the past where the current economic models doesn't work, companies to create security issues so we actually need this. 

Open Source Lingua Franca

So, I think the Open Source should be the Lingua Franca for all this stuff because it actually gives us this work flow where we actually communicate using open source.
