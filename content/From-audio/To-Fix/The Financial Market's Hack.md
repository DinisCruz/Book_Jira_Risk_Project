So we already had actually a massive market hack because I would argue that Portugal has already been victim to financial manipulations. 

Looking from the outside, lots of people on the financial that I know, they were totally playing with Portugal. I know some guys there, their best fund return on investment was the Portuguese debts, in other words, "hey, let's put a lot of money out of Portuguese debt because we know those guys are never going to default, and let's push the rates up because we know it is going to be safe" you know the system is wrong.

This is hacking by the financial markets and we know and you guys live with the day to day consequences of this that was done to us.

So, basically they push it hard, they make a lot of money betting that Portugal wasn't going to default and it didn't and we would continue to struggle. 

So that is the problem.
