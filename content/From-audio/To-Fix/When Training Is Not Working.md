One of the most frustrating things to do training on companies who don't actually share and capture knowledge is that it feels like groundhog day, where every session you start from scratch, every session you have to try to make the business case of why security is important. 

And you will always keep having the same conversations over and over again which is actually very exhausting for whoever does the training but also in essence it is a waste of money for the companies because you don't keep getting better, you don't evolve. You start a training session and you ask, "How many security champions are in the room? How many of you know of a security champion? Do you do threat models? What are your coding standards? And do you run automated tests on a continuously integration environment?"

And if the answer is no to all of these, it is kind of like, "What is going on? Why aren't these companies learning?" And I think that is one of the advantages of having a top-down application security team is that it can capture those, it can make them better, you can basically keep pushing those security activities down to the team and making sure that you always are a little bit better than you were before.
