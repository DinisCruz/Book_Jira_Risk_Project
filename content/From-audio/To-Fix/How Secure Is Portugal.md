So, how secure is Portugal, how secure is our infrastructure and companies? We have very digital companies, operation stuff and if you look at operation, most of them run on software.

So, Portugal is already one of those countries that already runs on software, probably hasn't realized that it runs on software.

I challenge you to find one company in Portugal, even from the most traditional thing that exists in here that actually doesn't depend on software for their livelihood, for their sales, for their management, for their purchases, for their everything. And if they do, the efficiency is very low.

So, everything is on software, and the question is how secure are they, how can they sustain an attack, how can they detect possible attacks and what is the probability of an attack happening in the short term? So, in a way, how secure are we?
