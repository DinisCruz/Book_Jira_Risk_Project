So, I really like this public health analogy. So what this is, is we need to choose a paradigm for AppSec or cyber security that we want.

And the paradigm is either going to be based on the military [top-down control, offensive] or public health [defensive and distributed]. 

This is very important because there is a term at which point we have gotten. In fact the US, UK and a lot of countries, they are totally going the military way, again we can change that.

And there is a reason for example why you don't let the army involve in your country. Because the army, which is the military in a lot of ways is designed to defend against our enemies.

So everybody is an attacker from an army point of view. Which is why when the US army went to defend Katrina, it was a hard show because for them the guys on the other side are criminals or attackers.

The police and civil forces focus on protecting individuals that makes a big difference.
