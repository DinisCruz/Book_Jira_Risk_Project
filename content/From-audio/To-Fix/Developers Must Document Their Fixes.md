Developers should never save the day without a ticket being created. It is very common for developers to do things behind the scenes to save the day. Where they fix things, they burn the midnight oil, they do things outside their normal work hours in a way because they care. 

Most developers program because they love programming which is great and they really care and they have a sense of craftsmanship about their product and they do go sometimes over and beyond what is required.

The problem is they should never do that in a way that isn't visible, in a way that is not recognizable because the problem is they are rewarding the status quo.

What they really should be doing is creating ticket, after ticket, after ticket even if they can close it when they have done it or even if they open a ticket after they have done it that is okay. But they are building a body of evidence of what they have done and that is absolutely critical.

And it is very important developers don't feel guilty for fixing those things, and don't feel guilty for creating those things because it is very rarely that it is the developer's fault.

The code exists as a result of an ecosystem of things and environment and the developer is just a small part of that it all depends about whether the management is pushing the right way, they are given enough time, they have enough understanding of the infrastructure, they understand the code base, all sorts of factors.

So it is very important that the developers are very pragmatic and very sometimes unemotional about the fixes that they do and what is required to do it and even the quality of the code that they produce. 

If the developer creates code that is below the quality bar they should document it, they should say, "hey this fix was not good so please accept the risk or here accept the side effect," because ultimately that is how you make management accountable for that environment.

So it is very key that developers document as issues in the back tracking system everything they do especially when they are saving the day, when they are making those changes that nobody else cares but the developers.

So it is fine for developers to talk to themselves. It is fine for them to make all this knowing that in the short term nobody is reading it, but somebody in the future will. 

So basically they are documenting for the future self, documenting for the future management, they are documenting for when somebody new comes along and actually cares.
