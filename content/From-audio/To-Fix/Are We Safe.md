So, the answer is we are very safe, and I was actually trying to find this word in Portuguese and I couldn't so maybe somebody can tell me in the end.

I couldn't find the difference in Portuguese between safe and secure. In English it exists, in Portuguese I couldn't find it.

So, are we safe today? Yes, we are safe! Do I use the internet? Do I use my card? Am I comfortable knowing that I am possibly going to be hacked now by a criminal?

I am pretty safe and I know what the underbelly looks like so if anybody should be paranoid, it should be me.

But are we secure? No, we are massively insecure! because our current 'secure state', the fact that we are secure, our current security state depends on a very low number of attackers with few skills and unsophisticated business models.

And this is important to understand, and this is major companies in the planet it is not just Portuguese companies although I think here we are going to be caught by the cross fire.

So, the bottom line is that we aren't attacked because we are secure, we aren't attacked because there aren't enough attackers.

But it is important to acknowledge this because then we can start to look at better solutions for that.
