This is actually a very key important point. We have to make sure that the next generation of internet users, including my kids, is that they don't have fear of the internet.

We have a situation where I don't want them to fear the internet, I don't want them to fear to govern their actions because we did that with terrorism and you could see what created it. We have a complete, irrational conversation about the real problems. So, we don't want the same thing to happen in security.

I don't want the first experience of these guys to be a hacked doll, a light bulb, a website, email account, a car, the door asking for some ransom ware to be paid.

This is already not science fiction by the way and it is only going to get worse. We don't want this world because this world will create a much bigger problem than we have now.
