So, our duty is to protect the internet, the internet is one of the assets or gifts to humanity. The first generation made it free and open and the success of the internet is actually a testament to those decisions now it is the time for our generation to do the same thing.

We need to realign the internet or else the internet for our kids is going to be very different. It is going to be command and control, it is not going to be open, it is not going to be free, and it is going to be a much poorer in a lot of ways society.
