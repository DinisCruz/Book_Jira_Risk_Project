So, before I continue I think it is very important to give a good disclaimer of what I mean by hackers and by hacking.

Basically, the hackers are the good guys. The hacking created the internet. Hack is to solve problems, this is what we were doing in University.

We learned the internet by hacking to the internet, I blew up my mum's phone system because I was trying to plug the modems to it. That is how you learn, you improvise, you learn, you hack that is what it is.  

The press abuse the term 'hacker', and they should really be talking about things like 'Malicious Hackers' or 'Cyber Attacks' or 'Cyber Criminals' because that is a much better term.

The way I look at it is that everything you do today on the internet was created and dreamed by hackers in the past.

So, when I am talking about hacking, I am talking about on this definition of hacking.
