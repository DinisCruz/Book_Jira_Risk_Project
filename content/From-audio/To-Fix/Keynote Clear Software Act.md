We can have the clean software act. And basically this is basically one like the 'Clean Air Act' that we had in the past that says now we are going to have code quality built in, it is a requirement.

We have done this for pollution, we can do the same thing for code. And again there is a great phrase that says, 'it is very difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.'

So yes there are a lot of people who don't like these ideas but they will adapt so that isn't a problem.
