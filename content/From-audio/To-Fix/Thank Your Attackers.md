The other thing that is very, very important when you look at it from the attacking point of view, is if they tell you about the attack, [and I know it might be painful when it is a leak or a document], but when the attackers actually physically let you know that they did something they are your best friends and you have to thank them because they will make you better from security point of view.

Because the criminals will not tell you. The criminal's business model is based on you not knowing that they are there.

So the reality is that once you know about the attack you are going to fix it, the security team is going to get a much bigger budget, we are going to be able to protect all these other things that we would love to do but nobody was paying attention now suddenly it is a massive priority.

So, ultimately every time there is a public attack, the outcome always tends to be net positive unless they are criminals, unless they have malicious intent then it is a completely different problem.

A kid that breaks into your network and dumps everything, you should hire him which is what we are doing now in a way with the bug bounties on this.

So, again the positive side effects of all that stuff is that you basically get better teams, better stuff and that is what happens.
