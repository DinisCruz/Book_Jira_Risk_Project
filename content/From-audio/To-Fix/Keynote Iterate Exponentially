I also don't believe on big changes, I believe on interactive and exponential changes so you start small you build, build, build just like we build software now.

So, again anybody who sells a big expensive solution is selling a scam, it is small changes, start small, deploy, learn it, make changes, go back step two and repeat.

That is how you build society that is how you make changes on a country and anything.
