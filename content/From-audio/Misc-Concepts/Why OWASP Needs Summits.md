### Why OWASP needs summits

We need these summits because, as a community and industry, we need a place where we can come together to work on ideas and on solutions.

We need places where we can have independent, non-vendor focused discussions about difficult problems and how to deal with them.

OWASP is one of the few organizations in the world that can provide that space. 

The problem with conferences is that their focus is narrow and they tend to be repetitive. In fact, interesting comments have been made about the lack of innovation at conferences, where we keep going around and around with the same topics and ideas.

As a result, the best part of conferences is the lobby part, when we meet and we talk informally with other delegates.

However, those conversations are very ad hoc, they aren't planned, and there is no preparation for them.

The OWASP summit allows you to prepare for those exchanges, because you know you will meet people who are interested in this topic, and you know there is going to be a critical mass of knowledge about a specific topic that you want to discuss and debate.

That is the power of the summit. The people who matter, and who have an interest in a specific topic, are there. More importantly, they are there to work, they are there focused on work and they want to create amazing and important deliverables.

What are those deliverables? That depends on the participants, and, in a way, it depends on how much they believe in the summit, and how much effort they put into it. 

All that we can do for an OWASP and as a community is to set the stage. It is up to the participants to create the magic and create something quite amazing.
