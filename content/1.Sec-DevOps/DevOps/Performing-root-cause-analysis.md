### Performing root-cause analysis

Some environments make it hard to perform root-cause analysis, because it is seen as a blame exercise instead of a learning opportunity.

Root-cause analysis is essential for any bug, especially bugs with security implications. The absence of root-cause analysis means that the business owners don't want to spend the time finding other, similar issues. Lacking the time to perform 'root cause analysis', or not understanding what caused a problem, are valid risks in themselves, and managers must accept those risks. Accepting them makes them 'real', and will motivate the business owner to allocate resources to root-cause analysis in the future, especially when a similar problem occurs.

In the DevOps world, the efficiency of any root-cause analysis depends on being able to replicate the issue in a simulated environment.

The end-result of a root-cause analysis should be a test, very close to a script, that passes when the issue can be replicated correctly and reliably.
