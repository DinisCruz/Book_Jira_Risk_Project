### Ten-minute hack vs one day of work

A ten-minute hack will create more RISK tickets and source comments than one full day's proper coding. Developers regularly ask me about this. There should be a quantitative difference, and that should be measured.

**That code sucks**

If someone says *"That code sucks"*, you should ask them to demonstrate why it is bad. Code analysts in IDE can help to identify known bad patterns and provide awareness of them. 

**In new code legacy**

If the code in question is hard to refactor and change, then yes, it is bad code.
