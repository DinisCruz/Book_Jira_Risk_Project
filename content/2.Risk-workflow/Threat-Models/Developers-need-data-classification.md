### Developers need data classification

Every type of data that exists in an organization, especially the data that is consumed by applications, needs to have a data classification mapping.

Developers should know if a particular piece of data is sensitive, and what value it holds for the business.

A good way to determine the expected level of confidentiality and integrity is to ask _'What would happen if a particular set of data were fully disclosed, for example uploaded to PasteBin?'_  or _'What would happen if some of the data was maliciously modified over a period of months?'_

These are difficult questions, and only by answering them can developers and business owners start to understand the value of a data set given-to, or generated-by, their application.

Developers should understand what they are dealing with, what is valuable to the business, and what needs to be protected.

See [Microsoft's Data Classification Wizard](https://www.microsoft.com/security/data) for a good list of data types that exist in large organizations (this will need to be tweaked per application)
