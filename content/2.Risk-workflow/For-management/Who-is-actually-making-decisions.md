### Who makes the decisions?

An interesting situation that occurs when we play the risk acceptance game at large organizations is how we find out exactly who makes the business and technical decisions in the company.

Initially, when a 'Risk Accepted' request is made, what tends to happen is that the risk is pushed up the management chain, where each player pushes their boss to accept the risk. After all, what is at stake is who will take responsibility for that risk, and in some cases, who might be fired for it.

Eventually there comes a moment when a senior director, or even the CTO, resists accepting the risk and pushes it down. This means that the decision to accept the risk must be made by someone else who has been delegated, either officially or implicitly, that responsibility.

In some cases, this can now go all the way down to the developer or team doing the coding. Paradoxically, the developer usually doesn't realize until that moment that he or she is the one who decides how and when, or whether, to fix the risk.

Developers often hold a huge amount of power, but they are unaware of it.

Playing the risk acceptance game, and identifying who decides on risk, is a way to empower the decision-maker. Once the person realizes their role and power, they can ensure they have realistic time-scales to fix the issue, and they can make the case for more time, more resources, or even a more defined role as a decision-maker as the need arises.

This exercise is very important because, until you discover who clicks on the 'Accept Risk' button, there is little knowledge about who, if anyone, makes the important decisions in an organization.

Risk issues can only be on one of two moving paths: _'Fixing path'_ and _'Risk Acceptance path'_. Since deciding not to act on an issue is a decision in itself, the Risk workflow makes sure that issues don't 'disappear' in informal conversions, emails or documents.

This is also a good example of why _Pollution_ is a better analogy than _Technical Debt_. Features that are pushed with un-realistic deadlines or bad briefs will create a higher number of Risk tickets (i.e. pollution) which must be accepted by the business owners who agreed on the development brief and time-scales.
