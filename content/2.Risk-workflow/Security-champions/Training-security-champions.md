### Training Security Champions

Good training is essential to develop and improve SC skills. The best training is done on top of languages and frameworks the SCs already use. Wiki pages with links to issues, and relevant resources, make a massive difference.

Using and exploiting vulnerable-by-design apps, or older versions of current main apps with known vulnerabilities, are a great way to learn. 
Writing exploits and finding vulnerabilities is a key step of the required, accelerated, learning curve. 

### Making Security Champions AppSec Specialists

Once you have SCs you need to develop them, and good training is essential to their growth. 

I can make a good developer, who is interested and dedicated, into a good AppSec specialist in 6 months. If the developer is an expert in AppSec, then he should join the central AppSec team.
