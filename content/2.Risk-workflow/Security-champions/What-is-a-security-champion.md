### What is a Security Champion and what do they do?

Security Champions are a key element of an AppSec team, since they create a cross-functional team focused on Application Security. They help to decide when to engage the Security Team, and they act as the _"voice"_ of security for the given product or team.

### What it takes to be a Security Champion

It is important to understand that AppSec skills are not a key requirement to become a security champion. To become a security champion, it is essential that you want to be one.

You need a mandate from the business that will give you at least half a day, if not one full day per week, to learn the role. The business should also provide the means to educate and train you and others who wish to become security champions. Increasing and spreading knowledge will increase awareness and control.

You need to be a programmer, and understand code, because your job is to start looking at your application and understand its security properties. You should also know 'the tools of the trade', and how to implement them, in the most efficient way. Lastly, you must be able to identify useful metrics and instruct on how to obtain them.
