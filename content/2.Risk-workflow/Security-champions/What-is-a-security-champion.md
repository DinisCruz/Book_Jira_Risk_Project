### What is a Security Champion and what do they do?

Security Champions are a key element of an AppSec team, since they create a cross-functional team focused on Application Security. They help to decide when to engage the Security Team, and they act as the _"voice"_ of security for the given product or team.

     *  Reviews impact of 'breaking changes' made in other projects
  *  Attends weekly meetings
  *  Is the contact point for their assigned team
  *  Ensures that security is not a blocker on active development or reviews
  *  Assists in making security decisions for their team
     *  Low-Moderate security impact
        *  Empowered to make decisions

### What it takes to be a Security Champion

It is important to understand that AppSec skills are not a key requirement to become a security champion. To become a security champion, it is essential that you _want_ to be one.

You need a mandate from the business that will give you at least half a day, if not one full day per week, to learn the role. The business should also provide the means to educate and train you and others who wish to become security champions. Increasing and spreading knowledge will increase awareness and control.

You should be a programmer who understands code, because your job is to start looking at your application and understand its security properties. It is difficult to be an AppSec SC who is unable to code. You should also know 'the tools of the trade', and how to implement them, in the most efficient way.

Look at the application from the point of view of an attacker. In the beginning, the best way to learn this approach is to think about all the entry points of the application (i.e. inputs).

This includes everything the attacker can control: from GET/POST parameters, to web services calls, to headers, cookies, websockets; think about anything that enters the application.

After that, authorization is also a great way to take a look.

Basically, start with creating threat models :)

Looking at how you handle data and how you authorize is another great way to understand how the application works.

Lastly, you must be able to identify useful metrics and instruct on how to obtain them.

### Hack anything that moves

You should hack anything that moves in your company, because you have a mandate to protect your own company (in some companies it might be better to get this 'hack everything' authorization via official channels).

In terms of targets, you can go for your own company, for your own application, or for your colleagueâ€™s application (which sometimes is a bit easier to digest).

### Bug Bounties

Go for bug bounties, which is a list of companies that give you permission to _'hack'_, or _'attack'_ them and find vulnerabilities.

### Market demand for AppSec Professionals

At the moment, there is huge demand for AppSec devs, and consequently opportunities exist for developers to move into AppSec. Historically, the path to InfoSec was via Network Security, which means that most InfoSec professionals cannot move to AppSec, because they can't code professionally, as they have no real knowledge of how to build, test, and ship software or apps.

It is also possible to learn on the job, since there is such a shortage of AppSec professionals. This makes it easier to hire devs who like AppSec and then train them up.
