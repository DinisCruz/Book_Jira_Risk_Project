### Weekly meetings

SCs should hold regular meetings to discuss work-on-hand, ideas, issues and any industry news or developments that have arisen since the last meeting. Ideally, meetings should happen every week, but a good compromise is for them to occur every second week.

Everyone attending should understand why these meetings are so important, what they can expect to take place at the meetings, and who should attend.

Everything shown and discussed at the Security Champions meeting needs to be done via one or more slides, which should be added to that week's slide deck.

These slides are VERY important when creating learning materials.

Admin support for the meetings should create wiki pages with a full list of all past SC meetings, with each entry categorized by labels.
These pages are a great way to teach Security Champions and to call their attention to areas in their own apps they might wish to research.

I've seen many cases where Security Champions see a presentation on a topic or technology relevant to their current domain and realize  _"Humm... I think we might be vulnerable to THAT vulnerability"_.

Initially, it will take considerable effort to generate content for these meetings; to find presenters, and to keep it engaging, relevant, and interesting.

The meeting organizers must think of the money that it costs the company to have all those resources at the meeting. Therefore, make the meeting count and don't waste participants' time. Developers are very busy and if the meetings are not relevant, or not interesting, they just won't turn up.

To help kick start the meetings, and to keep energy levels up, the central AppSec team should always be looking for topics to present at the next SC meeting. Topics could include the following:

 * Threat Models
 * AppSec Questions
 * AppSec ideas     
 * events from the attacker's point of view
   * attacks
   * AppSec news
   * any AppSec related topic that has not been presented recently)

#### Agenda items for discussion at weekly meetings

The following examples give an idea of what to present at the weekly or fortnightly meetings:

  * Latest news on AppSec (DDoS, exploits, etc.)
  * Latest bug-bounty findings and payments (an excellent source of real-world examples)
  * Issues found and issues fixed (on the SC's application or service)
  * Secure coding techniques
  * Security tools and technologies (e.g. OWASP ZAP Project, OWASP dependency checker)
  * Tools/techniques to improve the Developer's Productivity (e.g. WallabyJS, NCrunch)
  * Hack challenges
  * Security reviews currently in place
  * Other OWASP tools and documents (ASVS, Owasp SAMM, AppSensor, Testing Guide)
  * Testing techniques, workflows and technologies used (which might be different from the current development stack)
