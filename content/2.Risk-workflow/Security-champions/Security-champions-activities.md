### Security Champions' activities

What do Security Champions do in the time they spend on security activities?

It is very important to use JIRA tickets to map, track and allocate the tasks Security Champions undertake and complete.
The number of JIRA tickets generated justifies the work the SC does. It also provides movement and management information about what is being done in the company. 

It is important to have a good number of actionable tasks, in the _'Allocated for Fix'_ stage (Between 30 and 50 is a good number, but the tasks must be realistic).
You will know the model is working when the managers ask: _"Do you have enough time of those SC activities?"_, or _"Do you need help from other team members (i.e. more resources)?"_

Eventually, the SC should also manage the AppSec tasks that other team members usually perform. The time allocation is better if done in blocks of 4h (over two days), or 2h every day (at the same time).
